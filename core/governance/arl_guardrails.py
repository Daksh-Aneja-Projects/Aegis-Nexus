# [CONFIDENTIAL] PROPRIETARY CODE - IMPLEMENTATION REDACTED
"""
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (ARL) Guardrails
Implements a "Red Team" GAN logic that probes the Z3 solver during idle cycles.

Purpose:
"Vaccinate" the system against prompt injections by generating adversarial inputs,
verifying them against Z3, and updating the "Safety Policy" if a bypass is found.
